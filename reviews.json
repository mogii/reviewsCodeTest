      "description":"I have been seeing Dr. Zimmer since he was fairly new to his practice - about 25 years ago. I have never a bad experience. I have watched his practice evolve into the practice that it is today. If you have fear of dentists, Dr. Zimmer is the dentist to see. If your wish is to have your own teeth in your mouth at the end of your life, Dr. Zimmer will help in that effort. He is kind, compassionate and careful. His pricing is comparable to others and never a delay in appointment time. Yes, he sees other patients at the same time, however, that is usual for other dentists, and doctors. A visit to      Dr. Zimmer is a normal amount of time depending on the work. I give his overall  practice, his front office staff, his hygienists and Dr. Zimmer a 5 star rating. ",

      "description":"Dr. Zimmer is nice and convenient place for those who work down town. Was the first dentist I had seen in eight years since I school. I originally when to him because of a badly shattered tooth from a root canal performed by another dentist. Zimmer laid out my options with least to most expensive with which he thought was the right approach to save what was left of my tooth. Since then the tooth has had some complication, but he has stood behind his work with very little or no cost to me to save my tooth. Zimmer does get you in and out of the office quickly without sacrificing quality care and for me that&#39;s a plus as I usually schedule my appointment during lunch or before work. Still Zimmer is quite personable. I&#39;ve been to multiple dentists, some wanting to give you unneeded work. Zimmer has so far been the best one. Most of my friends who now use him agree.",

      "description":"This is NOT the dentist or office you want to deal with. EVER. For me it was one horrible experience, then another, then another. I had my top 2 wisdom teeth removed last fall and also had them do my fillings (I needed 6, so I thought why not do it all) through conscience sedation. I was told I would not remember the surgery, I wouldn&#39;t feel anything, &amp; that there was nothing to fear. The problem was, they didn&#39;t give me a high enough dose of the sedation pill and they didn&#39;t numb me enough. That resulted in me remembering 80% of the procedure. I can still feel him yanking on my tooth and hearing my roots rip as he pulled me tooth out. More importantly, I clearly remember the tears rolling down my face as I laid there in pain, supposed to be sedated. It was awful. When I told him that I remembered the entire surgery, including all the fillings being done by some girl who I had never met; he said that shouldn&#39;t have happened. He said I probably wasn&#39;t given a high enough dose of the pill. He apologized and said that they would discount my already paid-for sedation costs, since I wasn&#39;t properly sedated. When I went to the desk and spoke to Cindi (their main front desk clerk) about crediting back my card, she made a loud, bold statement in front of another patient, that basically it was my fault I wasn&#39;t sedated and that I shouldn&#39;t have asked for a discount. I didn&#39;t ask for any discount, at all! He offered it! That other patient turned to me in the elevator &amp; said nobody should ever be able to speak to patients like that and his wife was another victim of one of Cindi&#39;s outburts. All of the fillings had to be redone, because they were done incorrectly causing me severe pain. Today was the final filling fixes. My appointment was at 3pm. It was an hour appointment. I was told he would probably be able to squeeze me in early, as I was finished with my cleaning at 2:45. By 3:30, he still hadn&#39;t come into the room. When he finally did, he checked them out &amp; said he was going to numb me. I reminded him, I need a lot of numbing, as I&#39;ve had a problem mouth since I was little. I know that my teeth never respond with just a &quot;little pinch.&quot; He said it should be fine as they were top teeth; he shot me up, walked away, and began working on another patient. How I know this, is because they were next to me and I heard him! 45 minutes later, he comes in, starts drilling, and realizes surprise! I wasn&#39;t numb! Shoots me up again, walks away and works on yet ANOTHER patient. This cycle happened on both sides of my mouth, over and over again. It was 5:25pm, he had completed one side, numbed me up, and was nowhere to be found. I finally had enough. I stood up and started saying that I was upset to the assistant. He came walking in, said how sorry he was, shot me up once again, and rushed through my last two fillings. It was 5:45pm; and I finally was done. 20 minutes for 2 fillings...why did it take 3 1\/2 hours to complete 3 fillings? RUN the other way. The office is pretty but don&#39;t judge a book by its cover.",

      "description":"I love Dr. Zimmer. I&#39;ve been coming here for the 6-month cleaning for a few years but recently had to have a bit more extensive work done and was even more impressed by the level of caring and dedication that he and his staff have to their patients. I had an &quot;omg, my tooth hurts&quot; moment a few weeks back and his staff fit me in without issue. A few weeks later, I had 3 wisdom teeth removed and after some painful complications, he [personally] texted me to make sure I was doing okay. Way to go the extra mile, Dr. Zimmer. Yes, his hygienists are hot. And yes, they wear bright pink gloves. And yes, he has racy artwork on the walls. And yes, his office is a swank loft-style space on the top floors of the dental building downtown. I&#39;m not sure why other reviewers refer to these things as negatives. I think they all lend towards the overall awesome-ness of his office. Mostly though, he&#39;s gentle and caring and will stop what he&#39;s doing if you say you&#39;re experiencing any sort of pain. I&#39;ve referred many people to Dr. Zimmer&#39;s office, and would recommend him without doubt to anyone that&#39;s looking for a dentist in the seattle area.",

      "description":"Just go somewhere else. Please do not go here for any dental work. I only got a filling, which should be routine work, but this office was crazy. Dr. Zimmer see&#39;s 8 patients at one time whether he&#39;s just checking up or doing surgery. This means that he pops in, goes to town on your teeth and then leaves. My filling was equivalent to a tire change at the Daytona. In business, this is high turnover and poor customer service. He didn&#39;t even look at me when talking, it&#39;s like he was automated. The staff is young and cute which I assume is for distraction and low pay. After my filling was done, I realized that floss would get caught because he didn&#39;t have time to smooth out the filling. The office also over billed my insurance saying they put a filling on 2 surfaces of one tooth, which was not the case, it was only one surface (my mom is a dental hygienist who double check the work). Not a huge deal unless you get work another time on that second surface, which the insurance does not cover for another 2 years. Long story short; just go somewhere else if you want a decent job. I think we deserve to have the time and care our teeth need, you only have one set!",
